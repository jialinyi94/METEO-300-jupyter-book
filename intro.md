# Introduction

I am a computational notebook about Fundamental of Atomospheric Sicence. Pennsylvania State University has [an awesome open course](wiki:book): hover over the link for more information.

The PSU course uses Math to understand atmospheric science... But this notebook uses _Python_!

If you use Math to study atomospheric science, you'd see physical equation [](#eq:book). 
Instead, if you use Python, you'd see code like:

```python
pressure * volume = num_moles * GAS_CONST * temperature
```
Looks more informative, right?

Let's end the introduction with a beautiful picture showing the atmosphere environment we will study in this book in [](#fig:atmosphere)!
